# Consuming Python APIs with React [Video]
This is the code repository for [Consuming Python APIs with React [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/consuming-python-apis-react-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788396073), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
One of the best things about Python is that it fits well into the web developer’s skill set. With the help of Django, Python’s high end web framework, you can rapidly develop your own websites and build web APIs that are clean and easy to maintain and re-write, all while allowing you to integrate your Python code with powerful JavaScript frameworks like ReactJS.

This video tutorial will guide you in developing a React based front-end for your Python web application. You will start with quickly setting up your JavaScript tools and NodeJS, as well as ReactJS for a Bookmarking Application project. After that, you will put together your basic frontend code for interacting with your Django backend. You will learn to build and use React components for your application’s UI, and work with your React code’s data and state that will determine how your application behaves. You’ll also explore routing and event handling for your application. From there, you will dive into backend interaction details, such as authentication for login. You will learn to consume your Django resources and also create, update, and delete item data. You’ll also learn specific tasks such as managing your bookmarks and counting and collecting likes and comments on your bookmarks.

By the end of this course, you will have successfully integrated your Python web application’s backend with a ReactJS frontend, giving you a taste of real-world full stack Python web development.
